# Mattermost plugin for OpenProject
This plugin provides integration for OpenProject features in Mattermost. It emulates an existing [slash command integration](https://github.com/girish17/op-mattermost). This plugin's work progress can be tracked [here](https://github.com/users/girish17/projects/4)

Following enhancements (on top of the [existing slash command features](https://github.com/girish17/op-mattermost/wiki#about-op-mattermost)) are supported:
- Authentication for an OpenProject user through Mattermost
- A directly installable plugin for Mattermost
